        <p class="inset">Coronavirus is a respiratory illness that is spread from person to person. 
            <br> It is spread through respiratory droplets including saliva, coughs, and sneezes.<br>This is the most common transmission. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus into the air from their nose or mouth.<br>
             Anyone who is within 6 feet of that person can breathe it into their lungsCurrent evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. <br>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.<br>
            Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range
            The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. <br>this is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance </p>

                COVID-19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​
 
                <br>If you’re at high risk, know what to do, and take the right actions now to protect yourself.​

                <br>If you’re not at high risk, do your part to prevent the spread of coronavirus to those who are.
                <br>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

                Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
                 Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.

            <h1 class="section-title">effect of Covid-19</h1>
            <p class="double">National COVID-19 will most likely affect the economy through supply, chains, demand, and financial markets, affecting business investment. household consumption, and international trade Global The economy has practically ground to a halt. Bloomberg Economics estimates that GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 has slowed to 12% year on year-weakest on record
                The virus moves down your respiratory tract. That’s the airway that includes your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. Your lower airways have more ACE2 receptors than the rest of your respiratory tract. So COVID-19 is more likely to go deeper than viruses like the common cold.

Your lungs might become inflamed, making it tough for you to breathe. This can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the tiny air sacs (called alveoli) inside your lungs where your blood exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide.

If your doctor does a CT scan of your chest, they’ll probably see shadows or patchy areas called “ground-glass opacity.”

            <h1 class="section-title">social distancing</h1>
            <p class="double">COVID-19 is easily spread to those who are within close proximity to each other to practice groups and or least 6 feet apart do not gather in large groups, and avoid This gatherings or crowds. Experts agree that the COVID-19 Cough outbreak cannot be stopped but implementing social distancing and reducing community contact has proven to be highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve
                In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other. It usually involves keeping a certain distance from others (the distance specified differs from country to country and can change with time) and avoiding gathering together in large groups.

By minimising the probability that a given uninfected person will come into physical contact with an infected person, the disease transmission can be suppressed, resulting in fewer deaths. The measures may be used in combination with others, such as good respiratory hygiene, face masks and hand washing. To slow down the spread of infectious diseases and avoid overburdening healthcare systems, particularly during a pandemic, several social-distancing measures are used, including the closing of schools and workplaces, isolation, quarantine, restricting the movement of people and the cancellation of mass gatherings. Drawbacks of social distancing can include loneliness, reduced productivity and the loss of other benefits associated with human interaction.

Social distancing measures are most effective when the infectious disease spreads via one or more of the following methods, droplet contact (coughing or sneezing), direct physical contact (including sexual contact), indirect physical contact (such as by touching a contaminated surface), and airborne transmission (if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods). The measures are less effective when an infection is transmitted primarily via contaminated water or food or by vectors such as mosquitoes or other insects. Authorities have encouraged or mandated social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic as it is an important method of preventing transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 is much more likely to spread over short distances than long ones. However, it can spread over distances longer than 2 m (6 ft) in enclosed, poorly ventilated places and with prolonged exposure.
